Every object will have States (variables) and behaviors (methods)
Plan / Design / BluePrint / Template
Classes are logical, object are physical
Process of creating object from class is instantiation
Object = instance

Abstraction - showing essential parts / managing complexities
Encapsulation - code is to be written in class body, Access Specifier (restrict visibility of programming component) + Packages, 
Inheritance - Re-usability, extends existing features, aggregation (has _ a), Method overriding
Base class / Super class / Parent Class - Derived class / child class / 
Polymorphism - many forms (method overloading  - static polymorphism - early binding - compile polymorphism / method overriding - Dynamic polymorphism - late binding, runtime polymorphism)
Carbon - Coal / Lead / Graphite / Diamond

language - keywords (48) + syntax

James gosling - OAK language - 

c++ - compile - .exe i.e. binary format m/c code (0,1) - OS specific - Cannot run on other OS

Java - compile - byte code (i.e. .class file) - Portable in any OS (Compiler + Interpreter based language)
WORA (Write once and run anywhere)

Convention - 
1. class name should start with capital, 2. if there are 2 words in class name, then first letter of those 2 words should be capital
3. Everything followed by parenthesis () is method
4. All method should start with small letter. Ideally, should be verb.
5. Variable name should not start with digit, cannot have embedded space. 
6. Variable name should Always start with small case letter. Second Word can be capital e.g. firstName
7. Variable name is case sensitive

System is inbuil class in java
Out - static member of System class, is object of print stream.
In - Input device
Err - Error

Primitive data types -
short, byte, int, long (whole number) - default value - 0
float, double (decimal number) - default value is 0.0
char (single char) - default value \u00000
Boolean (true/ false) - default value = false

Derived data types
String - default value is null
Why String class is immutable?? Cannot be changed. (Interview Question)

User defined data types
classes created by users

Internally Java supports Int, double data types

Variable -
1. Instance
2. Class
3. Local

new keyword create/allocate memory runtime, calls special method
